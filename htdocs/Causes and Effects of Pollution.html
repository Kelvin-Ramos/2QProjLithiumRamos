		Causes

			<div class="text">
				<div class="Cause">
					Trashes
				</div>
				
				<div class="Reason">
					The pollutants we see everyday are usually from our trashes in our households. These include plastics, styrofoam, glasses, etc. Because of lack of discipline, people tend to throw their garbages anywhere instead throwinf them to the right bin. These garbages are usually just thrown to an area, which makes the area inhabitable and polluted. 
				</div>
				
				<div class="Cause">
				Smoke-Producing Materials
				</div>
				<div class="Reason">
					Smoke-producing materials also contributes and plays an enormous role in pollution. These materials include cars, motorcycles, factories, etc. The smoke these produce make the air polluted and degrades the quality of air. These contribute to climate change and make our planet hotter every year.
				</div>
				
				<div class="Cause">
				Foods
				</div>
				<div class="Reason">
				Every year, lots of foods are wasted and go to the bin. These foods, become useless, and are just thrown anywhere. Even though many people suffer from starvation, a number of people still wastes foods. Without proper segregation, these become pollutants.
				</div>
				<div class="Cause">
				Animals
				</div>
				<div class="Reason">
				Animals can also pollute places with their wastes. Animals in cities can pollute parks, roads, sidewalks, etc. Some owners do not clean the wastes of their animals, which makes the area untidy. Cities' lands are usually covered with concrete, so the waste of the animal won't be absorbed by the soil.

		<div class="Article">
		
			<div class="text">
				<div class="Cause">
					Health Problems
				</div>
				
				<div class="Reason">
					Pollution play many factors in endangering our lives. Pollution affects our pulmonary system. Dust and small particles can lead to pulmonary problems, which could be fatal. Smoke from cigarettes or factories can cause serious problems like cancer. Insects, rats, and other pests are usually seen at polluted areas. These animals could possibly bring diseases and bacteria. When these got inside our body, we can have serious health problems.  
				</div>
				
				<div class="Cause">
					Inhabitability
				</div>
				<div class="Reason">
					Polluted areas can be inhabitable for us. The area could be fetid. The animals and bacteria living there can also affect our lives. The area can also affect our mood, work, and education.
				</div>
				
				<div class="Cause">
				Economic Instability
				</div>
				<div class="Reason">
					If the area is polluted, tourists tend not to visit it. Tourists commonly look for places that are beautiful and clean. This may affect the country economically. Tourism plays an important role in our economy, and lesser tourists may lead to economic instability.
